1) Use the appropriate command to list all files larger than 1 MB in the current directory and save the output to a file.

[22bcs038@mepcolinux embedUR_Assignments]$find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -size +1M > large_files.txt


2) Replace all occurrences of "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" in a configuration file named config.txt, and save the updated file as updated_config.txt.

[22bcs038@mepcolinux embedUR_Assignments]$cat config.txt
localhost, localhost
localhost
[22bcs038@mepcolinux embedUR_Assignments]$sed 's/localhost/127.0.0.1/g' config.txt > updated_config.txt
[22bcs038@mepcolinux embedUR_Assignments]$cat updated_config.txt
127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1

3) Use the appropriate command to search for lines containing the word "ERROR" in a log file but exclude lines containing "DEBUG". Save the results to a file named filtered_log.txt.

4) Write a code to identify the process with the highest memory usage and then terminate it.


PID=$(ps aux --sort=-%mem | awk 'NR==2 {print $2}')
kill -9 $PID

5) Use the networking tool command and print all the gateway available in a sorted manner

[22bcs038@mepcolinux embedUR_Assignments]$ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}' | sort
